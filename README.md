# Force.com Connector
It is a .Net version of existing Excel Connector.
And, I am not a expert of VB.Net, so just ported VBA to VB.Net.

## What are different with Excel Connector
 * Support latest API version
 * Using API name for fields mapping, not labels
 * Add Translation Helper for multilingual environment

## To do
 * Performance tuning
 * Currently used many similar backgroundworker modal, need to refactoring.
